# Contrast Checker

This Java application allows users to work with colors in various ways. It provides functionalities to convert colors to grayscale, generate color shades, and compare contrast ratios between different colors.

## Features

1. **Convert to Grayscale**: Takes a given hex color and creates a grayscale version.
2. **Generate Color Shades**: Creates lighter and darker versions of a given color.
3. **Compare Contrast Ratios**: Compares contrast ratios between two lists of hex color strings according to W3C standards.

## Usage

Compile and run the `Main.java` file. The program will prompt you to enter a primary hex color. It will then perform various operations and save the contrast ratios in a CSV file.

### Input
Please enter the Primary hex color (e.g., `#FF5733`).

### Output
A CSV file containing the contrast ratios.
